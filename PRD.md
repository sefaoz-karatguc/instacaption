## Instacaption Web App
An AI powered web app to generate captions for Instagram posts. Caption generation will happen after user uploads the photos they wanna share and give a little brief about the post. AI will create the caption and give it back to the user. User will be able to copy it to the clipboard. We should keep created captions in supabase database, initially user doesn't have to be signed in, first trial is free for everyone, but if they wanna do for the second time we should be able to somehow check if they have done it before and warn them that they need to sign in to the app in order to generate the second or more captions. Offering Google Sign In and Instagram Sign In. Next-Auth is the provider
